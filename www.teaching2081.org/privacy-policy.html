					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>The Moving Picture Institute respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy and User Agreement (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) outlines information practices and responsibilities to users who visit teaching2081.org. Your use of the website or any teaching2081.org resources or services constitutes your agreement to the following terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Any questions or concerns regarding this Agreement may be addressed by contacting MPI by email, postal mail, fax, or telephone. Please see our contact page for details.</p>
<h4>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
<p>Many pages on the website may be visited without revealing any personal information. In some instances, additional information is required in order to provide the services that you request.</p>
<h4>SUBSCRIPTIONS</h4>
<p>In order to keep constituents updated about current programs and activities, teaching2081.org offers subscriptions to our electronic mailing list free of charge. MPI currently sends this information via email. The only information we require to join our email list is your email address. If you wish to receive the MPI Script by post, we will also require your street address, city, state, and zip code. If at any time you wish to change your preferences (or if you wish to remove yourself from distribution lists), you may do so by following the instructions in each email we send, or by contacting us.</p>
<p>MPI stores the information that we collect to create a profile of our users. This information is kept in order to provide information about MPI and may be used for solicitation purposes. We do not share, sell, or otherwise distribute email or fax information. MPI does not sell aggregate or specific personal information to outside firms, public or private.</p>
<h4>SUPPORT</h4>
<p>We offer a variety of ways to support MPI (click here: <a href="https://www.thempi.org/support/">https://www.thempi.org/support/</a>), and the specific information we require will vary based on the preferred method of contribution. DonorPerfect.com processes our secure online credit card donations.</p>
<h4>COOKIES</h4>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer that is tied to information about the user. MPI uses cookies sparingly and only to enhance our users’ experience of our website, to help us diagnose problems with our servers, and to otherwise administer the website. By using the website, you are expressly consenting to the use of cookies by MPI.</p>
<h4>LEGAL DISCLAIMER</h4>
<p>Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information if we determine that we are required to do so under local, state, or federal law, regulations, current judicial proceeding, a court order, or other legal process.</p>
<h4>LINKS</h4>
<p>This website contain links to other sites for your convenience. MPI is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content of those outside sites, nor do we endorse them. Furthermore, MPI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. Any information you share on such sites is not subject to the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. We encourage our users to use caution when they leave the website and to read the privacy statements of other sites, as they may that collect personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<p>MPI takes reasonable precautions to protect our users' information. When sensitive information is submitted via the website, MPI endeavors to protect it both online and offline. We cannot assure you that private information that you intend to keep confidential between yourself and MPI via email will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Agreement. No Internet transmission is ever 100 percent secure or error-free. You should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send via email. Once MPI obtains information that is intended to be treated as confidential, we use our best efforts to keep that information secure from third parties. We cannot guarantee that private information sent to us will never be seen by an unrelated third party.</p>
<p>When our online donation form asks for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, the information is encrypted and is protected with a technology called Secure Socket Layer (SSL).</p>
<h4>NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
<p>MPI reserves the right to amend or change this Agreement at any time and it may be modified without notice. You will be bound by any changes to this Agreement.</p>
